      Hi, My Name is Jamie and Welcome to my learning journal.
    </h1>

    <p class="about__me__text">
      I am 39 Years old and decided I need to change my career but reliase i
      need to acquire new skills. One subject i have also been interested in is
      I.T and love computers from when i was little. I stumbled across Front-End
      Web Development and imediately fell in love with coding.
    </p>

      My journey so far, My Successes and Struggles
    </h3>

    <p class="about__me__text">
      I began to learn coding back in Jan 22 where i set my self a goal of
      learning something new as currently not enjoying my career as i have been
      in the UK civil service for just over 20years now. I started doing some
      fre courses FreeCodeCamp and The Odin Project. Although i loved
      FreeCodeCamp i wasn't feeling the same for The Odin Project. This is when
      i stumbled across the Scrimba podcast and decided to give the Scrimba
      platform ago and started the Front_end developer career path.
    </p>
    <p class="about__me__text">
      If I look back since Jan 22, It's amazing what i have learnt considering i
      knew nothing about coding or HTML, CSS, Javascript. I feel i have learnt
      HTML an CSS pretty well but my current struggles is still Javascript. I
      feel i still don't have the confidence to build apps with JavaScript. I
      will continue learning and wont give up as i need a career change and
      really enjoying it and finding it interesting.
    </p>

    <h3 class="about__me__headings">My Goals 2023</h3>
    <p class="about__me__text">
      My main Goals are to get to grips with Javascript and really get to
      understand it so i am more confident. Learn some Javascript framewors as
      not learnt any of these yet.
    </p>
    <p class="about__me__text">
      My long term goal is to change careers and get into a job I love and
      enjoy. This seems like it's far, far away but I am determined and
      motivated to get there.

        Time to start learning Javascript, i just knew this was going to be

        essential and is amazing what it can do.
