        My coding journey so far with the Srimba Front-End career path.
      </h1>
      <p class="article__text">
        After starting to learn to code in Jan 22 I decided to take the next
        step and jump into the Scrimba Front-End Developer career path.

      />

      <h3 class="article__headings">How I got started with scrimba</h3>

      <p class="article__text">
        I found an interest in Front-End web development in Jan 22 and was
        already taking part in some free courses like FreeCodeCamo.org and The
        Odin Project. Although i loved FreeCodeCamp i didn't have the love for
        The Odin Project so much. I then started to listen to some podcasts and
        stubled across the Srimba podcast and loved it straight away. This
        prompted me to take an intreset and signup to the Front-end career path
        and currently on module 6 and am eally enjoying it so far.
      </p>

      <p class="article__text">
        My plan is to continue with the career path and take as mny other
        courses as well to further my knowledge. I still feel i need more
        lessons on Javascript as really fnding this challenging
      </p>

      <h3 class="article__headings">How I stay committed to learning</h3>
      <p class="article__text">
        I try to schedule in 2 hours a day to learn, weather this is actual
        coding, watching videos or reading, I make sure I am doing something and
        to be consistant each day.
      </p>

      <p class="article__text">
        I will continue to be consistant as I have learnt so much that
        <i></i> didn't know and not worry to much how long it is taking me.

          This module looks at more advanced javascript concepts and was
